    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 2025-11-23</p>

    <h2>Welcome to Everbound</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Everbound</strong>, your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use,
        and safeguard your information when you use our ebook reading application. By accessing or using Everbound, you
        agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the data necessary to deliver and improve your experience with our app and services. The types of
        information we may collect include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Details about how you interact with Everbound, such as pages visited, time
            spent reading, search queries, and feature usage. This data is anonymized whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Coarse Location:</strong> If you enable anonymous usage statistics, city-level location may be
            inferred from IP address of the device strictly for general analytics purposes. This is entirely optional,
            anonymized, and used to help us improve the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your ebooks, notes, highlights, and bookmarks are stored locally on your
            device. This information remains private and is never uploaded to our servers without your explicit action
            (e.g., if you use optional syncing features).</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Support:</strong> When you contact us for support or provide feedback, we may collect
            your name, email address, and the details of your inquiry to respond effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely for the purposes outlined below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhancing Your Experience:</strong> To deliver personalized recommendations, semantic search
            results, and accurate reading stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving the Product:</strong> To identify usage trends, troubleshoot bugs, and optimize app
            performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To respond to your feedback, send support updates, and inform you about new
            features or policy changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Your Data Stays Private</h2>
    <p><strong>Everbound is a local-first app</strong>, meaning your data remains on your device by default. We do not
        store, share, or sell your data to third parties. Optional syncing services, such as WebDAV for cloud storage,
        are entirely under your control, and Everbound never accesses or processes this data without your explicit
        consent.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>We empower you to take control of your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> All your local data (books, notes, highlights, etc.) can be
            accessed and exported directly from your device at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your data by clearing app storage or uninstalling the app. Synced
            data can be managed directly through your WebDAV or cloud provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of usage analytics and telemetry through the app's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, including
        encryption for sensitive data and secure app code practices. However, no method of transmission or electronic
        storage is 100% secure. We encourage you to protect your device with strong passwords and use trusted storage
        providers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Integrations</h2>
    <p>Everbound may integrate with third-party services, such as dictionary lookups or cloud storage providers (e.g.,
        WebDAV). We ensure these integrations respect your privacy, and we do not share your data with them beyond what
        is necessary for the requested functionality.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or services. Any updates
        will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically. Major updates will be communicated
        via in-app notifications.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or feedback about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, feel free to
        reach out to us at: <a href="mailto:neighborhoodnerdindy@gmail.com">neighborhoodnerdindy@gmail.com</a></p>
